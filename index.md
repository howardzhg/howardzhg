# About Me

Driven by a strong desire for data science and statistics lore and further academic training, I am actively applying for **PhD** in **data science** or **statistics** programs in 2024 Fall. 

I have over 3-year working experiences as an assistant accountant from 2019 to 2023, which included:
1. formulate annual budget;
2. monthly financial statements; 
3. data analysis and summary, such as revenue, audience rating, attendance rate and so on. 

Meanwhile, I served as Assistant Director of promotional videos and documentaries assisting in script writing and post-production for 20 documentary and promotional films because of my outstanding leadership and writing skill. 

In 2019, graduating with a great honor of **Outstanding Graduate** (**Top 3% in School of Science**), I received a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Hainan University, the best one in Hainan Province, China. My undergraduate thesis was on "A handwritten digit recognition algorithm based on spiking neural network", which was successfully chosen as **Outstanding Undergraduate Thesis (Design) in Hainan University**(**TOP 3%**).

I won **International 1st Prize** (**TOP 0.88%**) in China Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling (**CUMCM**) in 2017 (almost 110,000 participants).

Above all, I am skilled at mathematical modeling, data analysis, mathematical software, and several programming languages, such as Matlab, Lingo, SPSS, SQL Server, R, C++, and Python.
